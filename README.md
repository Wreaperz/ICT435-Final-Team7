# ICT435-Final-Team7
NMSU's ICT 435 Senior Project - Team 7 General Repo

This is just a general repo for all 435-Final team documents, etc.
It's meant to be a place for anything and everything; like a backup of any files that people deem worthy of upload.

Overtime, school files and assignments will be less likely to appear on this repo, and all that should be left is the actual programming files.

# How To Use The P.A.C. M.A.N. Project
1. Download the .zip file of the project and save it wherever you want.
2. Unzip the project, and then move your .pcap file into the *same directory as the executable*
3. Run the executable (it is pretty self-explanatory)
4. Screens 1 and 2 are just the title page and the project contributors. Screen 3 is the important one.
5. Enter all of the **required** information, as well as any other information you desire.
6. Hit the button to run the program

It's that easy!
